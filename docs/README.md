# jsoo-react

> React.js in OCaml.

## What it is

Jsoo-react are the bindings to [React.js](reactjs.org/) for the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) language, in particular, for [Js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview), a compiler that transforms OCaml bytecode into JavaScript.

Jsoo-react allows to write components in a way that is familiar for both OCaml and JavaScript developers.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- Support for both Reason syntax and OCaml syntax
- Integrated with Js_of_ocaml and the OCaml ecosystem
- Optimized output, small footprint on JavaScript bundles
- Heavily tested
