# jsoo-react

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/jsoo-react/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/jsoo-react/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

Bindings to [React](https://reactjs.org/) for [js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest), including JSX ppx.

Adapted from [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/).

`jsoo-react` allows to use React from OCaml, but it is still at the **experimental** phase: there is no published version in [opam](opam.ocaml.org/) yet, and the library is expected to break backwards compatibility often.

Bug reports and contributions are welcome!

## Getting started

### New project

For new projects, the best way to start is by using [Spin](https://github.com/tmattio/spin) with the [`spin-jsoo-react` template](https://github.com/tmattio/spin-jsoo-react/).

1. First, install Spin [following the instructions](https://github.com/tmattio/spin#installation).

2. Then run:

    ```bash
    spin new https://github.com/tmattio/spin-jsoo-react.git
    ```

    After that, check the newly created project readme to get started.

### Existing project

1. Install the `jsoo-react` package:

    ```bash
    opam pin add -y jsoo-react https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/jsoo-react.git
    ```

2. Add `jsoo-react` library and ppx to [dune](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) file of your executable JavaScript app:

    ```
    (executables
    (names index)
    (modes js)
    (libraries jsoo-react.lib)
    (preprocess
      (pps jsoo-react.ppx)))
    ```

3. Provision React.js library
    
    `jsoo-react` uses `require` to import React and ReactDOM. This means that you will likely need to use a bundler such as Webpack or rollup.js.

    Note that at this moment, `jsoo-react` is compatible with **React 16**, so be sure to have the appropriate constraints in your `package.json`.
